; * This is an example region config file.
; * 
; * If OpenSimulator is started up without any regions, it will ask you configuration questions to generate a Regions.ini file for you.
; * So there is no need to change this file directly, it is only for reference.
; * However, if you prefer you can also copy this file to Regions.ini and appropriately change the parameters below.
; * Only files ending with .ini and .xml in this directly will be loaded by OpenSimulator.
; *
; * You can multiple regions into one file or make one file per region
; * The section name is the region name
; *

[Default Region]

; *
; * You MUST change this! It will NOT be done for you!
